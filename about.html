    <p> 
        Hi everyone, I'm Prince Yadav recently graduated from central university of Rajasthan
         in electronics and communication engineering. I have proficient knowledge of php, javascript,
          HTML, CSS, MYSQL, Laravel,and Bootstrap. Using these my technical skills I did two project.</p>
          <p>
The first project is a CRUD application with image upload using Laravel . In this project, I demonstrated 
proficiency in Laravel 8, Bootstrap 5, jQuery-Ajax. I also developed full-stack web applications with CRUD 
functionality and image upload and implemented dynamic content, pagination, sorting, and searching to improve
 the user experience. Additionally, I am familiar with Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.</p>
 <p>
The second project is a bus management system . This web portal was designed for more than 10,000 customers
 at a time to view and book tickets and for station masters to view ticket status in less than 60 seconds and 
 schedule new buses. As a backend engineer for the bus booking system, I developed the database using PHP and 
 Xampp, designed forms and buttons using HTML and JavaScript, and collaborated with front-end developers to ensure
  smooth website functionality.
